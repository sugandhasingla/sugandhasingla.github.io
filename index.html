    <h3>Resiliency Considerations in Biomass to Biofuels Supply Chain Design Optimisation<right>July 2014- Mar 2015</right></h3>
    <h5>
      Research Assistant, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Bombay
    </h5>
    <h5>
      Guide: Prof Yogendra Shastri
    </h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed a Deterministic Optimization Model using Mixed Integer Linear Programming in GAMS which provides optimal supply chain network design for lignocellulosic biofuels produced in 13 County region of Southern Illinois, USA.</li>
      <li>Incorporated the theoretical concept of Regional Biomass Processing Depots (RBPDs) to quantitatively analyse and show their importance in reducing transport costs, acting as efficient storage locations and in turn, mitigating losses incurred due to disruptions in network such as loss of feed due to calamities like floods, drought etc.</li>
      <li>Developed a Stochastic Optimization Model to incorporate disruptions costs accounting for uncertainties in network by adding probable eventualities of the uncertainties in the model. The model provides the Optimized Supply Chain Design with quantized efficiency-resiliency trade-offs. Ananlysis shows substantial improvements in reliability can be made with marginal rise in operating cost without decreasing efficiency very much.</li>
      <li>Comparisons made between robustness of supply chains obtained from consideration and non-consideration of expected disruptions shows that substantial improvements in reliability can be made with marginal rise in operating cost without decreasing efficiency very much</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Reconciliation and Gross Error Analysis of Self Powered Neutron Detectors<right>Apr 2015 - Present</right></h3>
    <h5>
      Research Assistant, Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, India
    </h5>
    <h5>
      Guide: Prof Mani Bhushan and Prof Madhu Bellur
    </h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Grouped SPNDs with different dynamic characteristics into smaller clusters of SPNDs with higher correlation coefficients using K-Means Clustering Algorithms in MATLAB.</li>
      <li>Developed models using Principle Component Analysis based on Eigen-Decomposition of Covariance matrix of measurement data of SPNDs in clusters. The models are used for fault detection and diagnosis in defective SPND if any, based on measurement data from other SPNDs in the same clusters.</li>

    <h3>ITC Ltd. Kolkata, India <right>May-June 2013</right></h3>
    <h5>Improvisation of Supply Chain Management &amp; Logistics for 'Bingo'- Food and Beverages Division </h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Benchmarked the existing Supply Chain practice used for Bingo chips against the supply chain process followed for Lays and proposed key changes at the both heuristic and deployment levels to increase the efficiency of Supply Chain Design.</li>
      <li>Interacted with many retail and wholesale suppliers of bingo and lays in Kolkata region to understand the market dynamics for both products. </li>
      <li>Built Manual Demand Order &amp; Estimate Fidelity Error model in MS Excel, and incorporated them in Shortage Tool, which is the diagnostic tool for identifying the reasons for shortage between order quantity and the actual deliveries at WSPs to WDs. </li>
